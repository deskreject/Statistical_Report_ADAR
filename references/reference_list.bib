Open Innovation: Impact, Criticisms and JPIM's Role



Open Innovation: Impact, Criticisms and JPIM's Role



Chesbrough's ([17] ) book Open Innovation drew on decades of thinking from innovation scholars to develop the open innovation concept in a way that has resonated deeply with both managers and researchers (Noble, Durmusoglu, and Griffin, [81] ). Firms report that they are using open innovation tactics more intensely than ever (Chesbrough and Brunswicker, [23] ). In less than 15 years since the term open innovation was coined, a proliferation of review articles, special issues, workshops, conferences, and courses ranging from undergraduate to doctoral seminars have sprung up to provide avenues for research, education, and discussion of open innovation.



Chesbrough's ([17] ) book Open Innovation drew on decades of thinking from innovation scholars to develop the open innovation concept in a way that has resonated deeply with both managers and researchers (Noble, Durmusoglu, and Griffin, [81] ). Firms report that they are using open innovation tactics more intensely than ever (Chesbrough and Brunswicker, [23] ). In less than 15 years since the term open innovation was coined, a proliferation of review articles, special issues, workshops, conferences, and courses ranging from undergraduate to doctoral seminars have sprung up to provide avenues for research, education, and discussion of open innovation.



A recent review of research trends in the Journal of Product Innovation Management (JPIM; Antons, Kleer, and Salge, [5] ) found that open innovation is a hot topic, with several areas falling under the umbrella of open innovation also being considered popular (e.g., {\textquotedbl}alliances and cooperation,{\textquotedbl} {\textquotedbl}networks and network structure,{\textquotedbl} {\textquotedbl}idea markets and evaluation{\textquotedbl}). Another related area, {\textquotedbl}users and innovation,{\textquotedbl} was found to be an evergreen topic--that is, consistently relevant. Beyond JPIM, open innovation research has drawn downloads and citations across publication outlets (e.g., Linton, [72] ). Though open innovation is a common theme in JPIM today, it is fair to say that JPIM authors were not quick to attach their work to the term open innovation. Prior to 2010, only six JPIM articles referenced Chesbrough ([17] ), compared to 30 articles appearing in R{\&}D Management and 26 articles appearing in Research Policy over the same period. As a result, some of the earliest published literature reviews of open innovation research appearing in other journals make few references to JPIM articles (Huizingh [[55] ] references one JPIM article, while Dahlander and Gann [[29] ] reference zero JPIM articles). However, JPIM authors were working within existing literatures that fall under the umbrella of open innovation (i.e., mechanisms of open innovation) but tended to not quickly connect their research to the wider open innovation literature.[1] For instance, the literatures on new product alliances and supplier integration were established in JPIM well before the term open innovation was used. Despite their relatively late start, JPIM authors are embracing open innovation, with 57 JPIM articles between 2010 and 2016 citing Chesbrough ([17] ).

Any concept generating as much attention as open innovation will draw some level of criticism. To his credit, Chesbrough consistently acknowledges that his thinking builds on decades of innovation scholarship (e.g., Chesbrough, [17] , [21] ), though other authors have not always shared his historical perspective. Some detractors have viewed open innovation as {\textquotedbl}old wine in new bottles{\textquotedbl} (Trott and Hartmann, [100] ), with skepticism given to the assumption that businesses in modern history ever relied on a closed business model (see also Mowery, [79] ). As will be discussed further below, researchers have not always connected research on {\textquotedbl}open innovation{\textquotedbl} to the literatures focusing on individual mechanisms (and vice versa).

Here, we view open innovation as a broad, umbrella concept that envelops several pre-existing research areas. In the next section, we survey research on several individual mechanisms of open innovation and direct readers to published literature reviews where available. In doing this, we intend to help researchers form linkages to relevant disciplines that fall under the canopy of open innovation where these connections have at times been lacking. For example, Linton ([72] , p. 653) provides an illustration of the problems created by the lack of consistent linkages:

As open innovation research is to a significant extent a subsector of product development in an integrated supply chain management environment, a failure to use common language with the supply chain management community and acknowledge this link keeps two large research communities working on the same topic separately.

Through this essay, our intention is to present an inclusive perspective of research that should be considered under the broad umbrella of open innovation. Note that we do not attempt to systematically review open innovation research in this essay; there are two such review articles included in the virtual issue (Randhawa, Wilden, and Hohberger, [88] ; West and Bogers, [105] ). In an attempt to spur dialog and connect the sometimes disjointed literatures that constitute open innovation, our goal in selecting articles for the virtual issue is to highlight excellent research focusing on many distinct mechanisms of open innovation (Table [NaN] ), though these mechanisms are not collectively exhaustive. To select articles for the virtual issue, the authors independently began with a list of mechanisms and identified exemplar JPIM articles related to each mechanism. In making final selections, we sought a collective balance between new and older work with representation from a variety of methodological approaches. We were cognizant of the papers included in the JPIM co-creation virtual issue (Gemser and Perks, [45] ), wishing to avoid duplication. To include a diverse set of researchers, we limited multiple instances of any given author. Taking our lead from Thomas Hustad's introduction to the virtual issue of award-winning JPIM articles (Hustad, [56] ), Table [NaN] includes a brief suggestion as to why readers should consider reading each of the articles included in this virtual issue. In the next section, we identify literatures related to individual mechanisms to connect them with the wider base of open innovation research. Subsequently, this essay develops challenges for future open innovation researchers and discusses contemporary contexts for data collection that may aid researchers in addressing open innovation questions.

Surveying the Wider Open Innovation Research Domain



Surveying the Wider Open Innovation Research Domain



Before narrowing our focus, it is helpful to see the open innovation concept as closely intertwined with other growing contemporary areas of research. For example, the tenets of design thinking (see Glen, Suciu, Baughn, and Anson, [47] ) emphasize a deep customer understanding, external observation, and iteration for innovation with a constant focus on the business model. These ideas are all reminiscent of open innovation. Relatedly, the interest in business model innovation has rapidly increased (Chesbrough, [20] ; Massa, Tucci, and Afuah, [75] ) with more recent attention on open business models (Chesbrough, [18] ; Vanhaverbeke and Chesbrough, [104] ). Similarly, within the entrepreneurship literature, there is recent growth in research related to bricolage, which is defined by Senyard, Baker, Steffens, and Davidsson ([91] ) as {\textquotedbl}making do by applying combinations of the [both internal and external] resources at hand to new problems and opportunities.{\textquotedbl} This concept is inherently compatible with open innovation and the supposition that many firms turn to open innovation out of necessity (Lee, Park, Yoon, and Park, [68] ; Van de Vrande, De Jong, Vanhaverbeke, and De Rochemont, [102] ).

As has been true in other places within the larger innovation literature (Garcia and Calantone, [42] ), there have been numerous definitions of the term open innovation since the concept was introduced (Gianiodis, Ellis, and Secchi [[46] ] identify seven different definitions). According to Dahlander and Gann ([29] ), the most commonly used definition at the time remained Chesbrough's ([17] , p. xxiv) original definition: {\textquotedbl}open innovation is a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as firms look to advance their technology.{\textquotedbl} Subsequently, Chesbrough's own definition of open innovation has evolved, most recently to: {\textquotedbl}a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model{\textquotedbl} (Chesbrough and Bogers, [22] , p. 17). A congruent theme in these definitions is that open innovation is a firm-centric approach to innovation--thus distinguishing it from some parts of the user innovation literature (Baldwin and von Hippel, [6] ; Bogers, Afuah, and Bastian, [11] ; Bogers and West, [14] ). Though knowledge may enter the firm from any external source (and conversely, knowledge generated inside the firm can be commercialized by external parties), these definitions restrict open innovation's domain to innovation involving a business model. While a subset of researchers have taken a broader view of open innovation that does not necessitate organizational involvement (see Chesbrough, [21] ), even the more restrictive definitions encompass virtually limitless distinct mechanisms of openness (as illustrated in Table [NaN] ).

Starting in 2010, scholars began to review the quickly expanding research base connected to open innovation in published review articles. Table [NaN] summarizes six reviews of open innovation research. This is not an exhaustive set of open innovation literature reviews (there are other editorials and retrospectives/reviews such as Chesbrough, [21] ; Van De Vrande, Vanhaverbeke, and Gassmann, [103] ), but a cross section of useful review articles.

@article{Craig.2017,
 abstract = {Population health interventions are essential to reduce health inequalities and tackle other public health priorities, but they are not always amenable to experimental manipulation. Natural experiment (NE) approaches are attracting growing interest as a way of providing evidence in such circumstances. One key challenge in evaluating NEs is selective exposure to the intervention. Studies should be based on a clear theoretical understanding of the processes that determine exposure. Even if the observed effects are large and rapidly follow implementation, confidence in attributing these effects to the intervention can be improved by carefully considering alternative explanations. Causal inference can be strengthened by including additional design features alongside the principal method of effect estimation. NE studies often rely on existing (including routinely collected) data. Investment in such data sources and the infrastructure for linking exposure and outcome data is essential if the potential for such studies to inform decision making is to be realized.},

@article{Park.2015,
 abstract = {We study whether and how symbolic rewards based on social recognition affects the behavior of knowledge sharing in a self- organized virtual community. We find that a purely symbolic reward based on peer recognition significantly boosts the quantity of the awardee's knowledge sharing activity. This effect, however, is relatively short-lived. In contrast, longer-lasting positive effects are found for exploratory and collaborative behaviors: the users who received the symbolic reward expand the collective knowledge coverage by answering more frequently questions in topic areas outside their traditional domains and by providing more feedback to other users. There is some indication that this reward system triggers gaming behavior among the awardees who likely desire a higher-level reward in the system. While potentially leading to an inefficient distribution of collective efforts, such desires stimulated by the initial reward may also reinforce the reward system as an incentive mechanism to promote knowledge sharing within the community.

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to conceptually understand membership dynamics in the open source software (OSS) community, and (2) to explore how different network characteristics (i.e., network size and connectivity) influence the stability of an OSS network. Through the lens of Ising theory, which is widely accepted in physics, we investigate basic patterns of interaction and present fresh conceptual insight into dynamic and reciprocal relations among OSS community members. We also perform computer simulations based on empirical data collected from two actual OSS communities. Key findings include: (1) membership herding is highly present when external influences (e.g., the availability of other OSS projects) are weak, but decreases significantly when external influences increase, (2) propensity for membership herding is most likely to be seen in a large network with random connectivity, and (3) for large networks, when external influences are weak, random connectivity will result in higher network strength than scale-free connectivity (as external influences increase, however, the reverse phenomenon is observed). In addition, scale-free connectivity appears to be less volatile than random connectivity in response to an increase in the strength of external influences. We conclude with several implications that may be of significance to OSS stakeholders in particular, and to a broader range of online communities in general. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{vanMierlo.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

In recent years, cyberculture has informally reported a phenomenon named the 1{\%} rule, or 90-9-1 principle, which seeks to explain participatory patterns and network effects within Internet communities. The rule states that 90{\%} of actors observe and do not participate, 9{\%} contribute sparingly, and 1{\%} of actors create the vast majority of new content. This 90{\%}, 9{\%}, and 1{\%} are also known as Lurkers, Contributors, and Superusers, respectively. To date, very little empirical research has been conducted to verify the 1{\%} rule.

OBJECTIVE

The 1{\%} rule is widely accepted in digital marketing. Our goal was to determine if the 1{\%} rule applies to moderated Digital Health Social Networks (DHSNs) designed to facilitate behavior change.

METHODS

To help gain insight into participatory patterns, descriptive data were extracted from four long-standing DHSNs: the AlcoholHelpCenter, DepressionCenter, PanicCenter, and StopSmokingCenter sites.

RESULTS

During the study period, 63,990 actors created 578,349 posts. Less than 25{\%} of actors made one or more posts. The applicability of the 1{\%} rule was confirmed as Lurkers, Contributors, and Superusers accounted for a weighted average of 1.3{\%} (n=4668), 24.0{\%} (n=88,732), and 74.7{\%} (n=276,034) of content.

CONCLUSIONS

The 1{\%} rule was consistent across the four DHSNs. As social network sustainability requires fresh content and timely interactions, these results are important for organizations actively promoting and managing Internet communities. Superusers generate the vast majority of traffic and create value, so their recruitment and retention is imperative for long-term success. Although Lurkers may benefit from observing interactions between Superusers and Contributors, they generate limited or no network value. The results of this study indicate that DHSNs may be optimized to produce network effects, positive externalities, and bandwagon effects. Further research in the development and expansion of DHSNs is required.},

@article{Nagaraj.2017,
 abstract = {While popular platforms developed by knowledge-producing communities such as Wikipedia and Linux co-exist and compete with alternatives such as Encyclopedia Britannica and Microsoft Windows, we understand little about how such competition affects those knowledgeproducing communities. Our study examines how community members respond when communities are faced with competition: they may increase their contributions to help defend their community from competition, or they may decrease their contributions given that the need for their contribution is diminished. We examine how community members' contributions to OpenStreetMap, a widely-used digital-mapping platform, changed following the competitive entry of Google Maps. We exploit the phased entry of Google Maps in different countries over time. While we find an overall negative effect of competition on contributions, the effect is not uniform. Competition has a divergent effect on community members: it motivates established members to contribute but deters new potential members from joining the community. Further, competition has little effect on communities characterized by social interaction among its members. Implications for research on member contributions to community-based platforms, platform competition, and the effect of competition on organizations are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

For instance, the entropy always goes in terms of the horizon radius as rh and r{\^{}}2 respectively for h odd and even dimensions.

In this paper, we provide a review of the evolution of customer co--creation and related forms of customer participation and suggest a typology of recent methods of co--creation (open innovation with customers). Our typology is based on three dimensions, addressing (i) the customers' autonomy in the process, (ii) the nature of the firm--customer collaboration (dyadic versus community based), and (iii) the stage of the innovation process when the customer integration takes place. Along these dimensions, we then present specific methods of customer co--creation. We conclude with a number of suggestions for further research.},

Winning an award for voluntary work behaviors significantly increases subsequent core call center performance.

For psychologists and sociologists, in contrast, rewards and punishments are often counterproductive, because they undermine ``intrinsic motivation''. We reconcile these two views, showing how performance incentives offered by an informed principal (manager, teacher, parent) can adversely impact an agent's (worker, child) perception of the task, or of his own abilities. Incentives are then only weak reinforcers in the short run, and negative reinforcers in the long run. We also study the effects of empowerment, help and excuses on motivation, as well as situations of ego bashing reflecting a battle for dominance within a relationship.},

Popular discussion connects gamification to increased user engagement, service profitability, goal commitment and the overall betterment of various behavioral outcomes. However, there is still an absence of a coherent and ample body of empirical evidence that would confirm such expectations. To this end, this paper reports the results of a 2 year (1 {\th}1 year e betweengroup) field experiment in gamifying a service by implementing a game mechanic called `badges'. During the experiment a pre-implementation group (N{\textonequarter} 1410) was monitored for 1 year. After the implementation, the post-implementation (the gamified condition) group (N{\textonequarter} 1579) was monitored for another full year. Results show that users in the gamified condition were significantly more likely to post trade proposals, carry out transactions, comment on proposals and generally use the service in a more active way.},

Drawing from the strategic management and social science literatures, we explain how traumatic shocks, such as conflict, disease, and natural disaster, can alter the institutional and cultural paths that determine future business environments. Historical shocks can help clarify the origin of cultural and institutional differences and help provide causal inference about why these differences are correlated with organizational structure and strategy. We explain specific cultural and institutional mechanisms through which historical traumatic shocks persist as well as specific organizational factors influenced by these mechanisms. We also provide guidance on key approaches for empirically linking traumatic shocks with modern firms as well as common identification problems in these methods.

 abstract = {Digital distribution introduces many new strategic questions for the creative industries---notably, how the use of new digital channels will impact sales in established channels. We analyze this question in the context of e-book and hardcover sales by exploiting a natural experiment that exogenously delayed the release of a publisher's new Kindle e-books in April and May 2010. Using new books released simultaneously in e-book and print formats in March and June 2010 as the control group, we find that delaying e-book availability results in a 43.8{\%} decrease in e-book sales but no increase in print book sales on Amazon.com or among other online or offline retailers. We also find that the decrease in e-book sales is greater for books with less prerelease buzz. Together, we find no evidence of strong cannibalization between print books and e-books in the short term and no support for the sequential distribution of books in print versions followed by e-book versions.

@article{Greiner.1998,
 abstract = {The influence of history on an organization is a powerful but often overlooked force. Managers, in their haste to build companies, frequently fail to ask such critical developmental questions as, Where has our organization been? Where is it now? and What do the answers to these questions mean for where it is going? Instead, when confronted with problems, managers fix their gaze outward on the environment and toward the future, as if more precise market projections will provide the organization with a new identity. In this HBR Classic, Larry Greiner identifies a series of developmental phases that companies tend to pass through as they grow. He distinguishes the phases by their dominant themes: creativity, direction, delegation, coordination, and collaboration. Each phase begins with a period of evolution, steady growth, and stability, and ends with a revolutionary period of organizational turmoil and change. The critical task for management in each revolutionary period is to find a new set of organizational practices that will become the basis for managing the next period of evolutionary growth. Those new practices eventually outlast their usefulness and lead to another period of revolution. Managers therefore experience the irony of seeing a major solution in one period become a major problem in a later period. Originally published in 1972, the article's argument and insights remain relevant to managers today. Accompanying the original article is a commentary by the author updating his earlier observations.},

@article{Teece.1986,
 abstract = {This paper attempts to explain why innovating firms often fail to obtain significant economic returns from an innovation, while customers, imitators and other industry participants benefit Business strategy --- particularly as it relates to the firm's decision to integrate and collaborate --- is shown to be an important factor. The paper demonstrates that when imitation is easy, markets don't work well, and the profits from innovation may accrue to the owners of certain complementary assets, rather than to the developers of the intellectual property. This speaks to the need, in certain cases, for the innovating firm to establish a prior position in these complementary assets. The paper also indicates that innovators with new products and processes which provide value to consumers may sometimes be so ill positioned in the market that they necessarily will fail. The analysis provides a theoretical foundation for the proposition that manufacturing often matters, particularly to innovating nations. Innovating firms without the requisite manufacturing and related capacities may die, even though they are the best at innovation. Implications for trade policy and domestic economic policy are examined.},

The proposed matrix may be useful both for defining the necessary components of good theory and for evaluating and/or comparing the quality of alternative theories. Finally, a discussion of the way theories fit together to give a somewhat broader picture of empirical reality reveals the lines of tension between the two main criteria for evaluating theory.},

There are two major methodological paradigms in this literature: stated effort and real effort. In the stated-effort paradigm the researcher uses an {\textquotedbl}effort function{\textquotedbl} that maps choices to outcomes. In the real-effort paradigm, participants work on a task, and outcomes depend on their performance. The advantage of the stated-effort design is the control the researcher has over the cost of effort, which is particularly useful when testing theory. The advantage of the real-effort design is that it may be a better match to the field environment, particularly with respect to psychological aspects that affect behavior. An open question in the literature is the degree to which the results obtained by the two paradigms differ, and if they do, why. We present a review of methods used and discuss the results obtained from using these different approaches, and issues to consider when choosing and implementing a task. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

ENGAGING VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES: A HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL



Introduction1



Introduction1



User contribution is critical to online communities but also difficult to sustain given its public goods nature. This paper studies the design of IT artifacts to motivate voluntary contributions in online communities. We propose a dynamic approach, which allows the effect of motivating mechanisms to change across users over time. We characterize the dynamics of user contributions using a hidden Markov model (HMM) with latent motivation states under the public goods framework. We focus on three motivating mechanisms on transitioning users between the latent states: reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image. Based on Bayesian estimation of the model with user-level panel data, we identify three motivation states (low, medium, and high), and show that the motivating mechanisms, implemented through various IT artifacts, could work differently across states. Specifically, reciprocity is only effective to transition users from low to medium motivation state, whereas peer recognition can boost all users to higher states. And self-image shows no effect when a user is already in high motivation state, although it helps users in low and medium states move to the high state. Design simulations on our structural model provide additional insights into the consequences of changing specific IT artifacts. These findings offer implications for platform designers on how to motivate user contributions and build sustainable online communities.



User contribution is critical to online communities but also difficult to sustain given its public goods nature. This paper studies the design of IT artifacts to motivate voluntary contributions in online communities. We propose a dynamic approach, which allows the effect of motivating mechanisms to change across users over time. We characterize the dynamics of user contributions using a hidden Markov model (HMM) with latent motivation states under the public goods framework. We focus on three motivating mechanisms on transitioning users between the latent states: reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image. Based on Bayesian estimation of the model with user-level panel data, we identify three motivation states (low, medium, and high), and show that the motivating mechanisms, implemented through various IT artifacts, could work differently across states. Specifically, reciprocity is only effective to transition users from low to medium motivation state, whereas peer recognition can boost all users to higher states. And self-image shows no effect when a user is already in high motivation state, although it helps users in low and medium states move to the high state. Design simulations on our structural model provide additional insights into the consequences of changing specific IT artifacts. These findings offer implications for platform designers on how to motivate user contributions and build sustainable online communities.



In the growing digital economy, online communities have become central in bringing together large numbers of geographically dispersed individuals to spark novel ideas, collaborate on inventions, and share knowledge (Boudreau and Lakhani 2009; Goh et al. 2016; von Hippel 2005). Users in many of these communities (e.g., knowledge sharing platforms such as StackExchange and Quora) usually contribute voluntarily without receiving monetary compensation. To engage user contributions in such a setting, online communities commonly design information technology (IT) artifacts as motivating mechanisms (Ma and Agarwal 2007; Ray et al. 2014). Among these motivating mechanisms, various forms of {\textquotedbl}gamification,{\textquotedbl} such as badges, votes, and status systems, have been widely adopted (Zichermann and Cunningham 2011).

Despite their growing popularity, such design efforts do not always achieve positive results. Most of the online communities (even famous ones like Wikipedia) face the challenge of declining user participation over time (Simonite 2013). In particular, inappropriate design could alienate users and drive them away. For instance, Wikipedia's quality control mechanism was counterproductive in retaining new users (Halfaker et al. 2013). In the case of the social news aggregator Digg.com, the redesign efforts angered users and lost them to competitors (Metz 2012). While social comparison can encourage users below the median to contribute more, users above the median could decrease their contribution to conform to the social norm (Chen et al. 2010). Goal-setting can induce users to exert efforts, but it can also reduce efforts after users reach the goals (Goes et al. 2016).

From a theoretical perspective, the design of such mechanisms is related to individual motivations, which are extensively studied in the literature (e.g., Ma and Agarwal 2007; Porter and Donthu 2008). Yet, these motivations are usually theorized as static, even though recent research suggests that users' contribution patterns exhibit significant dynamics (Sauermann and Franzoni 2015). Fitting a static model to data generated by a dynamic process may result in misleading findings. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has empirically analyzed the dynamic relationship between motivating mechanisms and voluntary user contribution in online communities. This leaves a gap in our understanding of how a user's motivation and contribution are dynamically influenced by the design of motivating mechanisms.

In this paper, we focus on the design of motivating mechanisms through IT artifacts when user motivations can change, and investigate the following research questions: (1) What kinds of mechanisms and IT artifacts are effective to transfer users among different levels of motivation? (2) How much would users contribute given their levels of motivation? An understanding of the dynamic effect along these two dimensions is essential to better design IT artifacts and effectively motivate user contributions.

In contrast to the literature, we take a dynamic approach. Specifically, we propose a structural econometric model, in which we integrate a hidden Markov model (HMM) into the public goods framework. This structural approach characterizes the dynamics of user contributions with different motivation states, as well as the transition between the states. With a unique panel data set collected from a knowledgesharing community, we use Bayesian estimation to jointly estimate the effect of motivating mechanisms on transition probabilities between the states, and user contributions conditional on their motivation states.

We find that the same motivating mechanism could work differently across states. For example, reciprocity is only effective to transition users from low to medium motivation state, whereas peer recognition (such as votes and acceptance from other users) is effective to elevate all users to the high motivation state. Badges are effective to transfer a low- or mediummotivation user to the high motivation state, but surprisingly, they show no effect when a user is already in the high motivation state. We also find that users do respond more to the demand of knowledge (i.e., number of questions that match their expertise) when they are in higher motivation states. These results provide important implications for the design of IT artifacts in online communities, and open up a new area for community managers to explore.

Our research has several features. First, we advance the literature from the conventional static approach to a dynamic perspective on voluntary user contributions, bringing about managerial insights unavailable in prior studies. Second, our structural model helps advance the modeling approach in the online community literature, as it explicitly characterizes the dynamics of user contributions at the individual level. Third, our dynamic approach provides more nuanced insights into an increasingly important mode of open collaboration, and is applicable to a wide range of online communities where user contributions are voluntary and fluctuate over time (Xu et al 2012).

Literature Review



We draw on the literature to build a theory of dynamic motivation and contribution in online communities. We first examine factors that affect user motivation, and illustrate how the design of IT artifacts can influence contribution through various motivations. Then we identify the dynamics of motivation and contribution as a gap in the literature, which motivates our hidden Markov model to characterize such dynamics.

User Motivation and IT Artifacts as Motivating Mechanisms



User Motivation and IT Artifacts as Motivating Mechanisms



In online communities, motivation is the key driver of user contribution. The literature has distinguished three types of motivations: intrinsic, extrinsic, and internalized extrinsic motivation (for a review, see von Krogh et al. 2012). Intrinsic motivation stems from intrinsic benefits, such as joy, fulfilment, and self-efficacy (Kankanhalli et al. 2005; Ray et al. 2014). In contrast, extrinsic motivation is driven by economic rewards such as career prospects (Huang and Zhang 2016; Roberts et al. 2006).

In contrast, extrinsic motivation is driven by economic rewards such as career prospects (Huang and Zhang 2016; Roberts et al. 2006).



Internalized extrinsic motivation is unique, in that it arises from external influences at first, but users can assimilate these influences and perceive them as self-regulating behavior rather than external impositions (Deci and Ryan 2002). In online communities, internalized extrinsic motivation includes reciprocity and reputation (von Krogh et al. 2012). Reputation can be further classified as peer recognition and selfimage. We discuss these three factors below.

First, reciprocity suggests that users who have received others' help tend to return the favor. It is shown to drive contributions in open source software (Lakhani and von Hippel 2003; Zhu and Zhou 2012) and online communities (Chiu et al. 2006). Second, social interactions, especially peer recognition, validate users that their role in the community is expected (Ray et al. 2014). This identity-verification process enhances the confidence of contributors, and reassures users to contribute with their unique identity (Ma and Agarwal 2007). Third, concerns over self-image can also motivate contribution, as people care about the way others perceive them (Benabou and Tirole 2006). In online communities, it is common that users contribute in order to earn respect from others and build a better image (Kankanhalli et al. 2005). It is also shown that self-image is important to drive participation in social media (Toubia and Stephen 2013).

It is also shown that self-image is important to drive participation in social media (Toubia and Stephen 2013).



Through its influence on internalized extrinsic motivation, an online community can affect users' contribution by employing various IT artifacts as motivating mechanisms (Ma and Agarwal 2007; Peng and Dey 2013). Examples of such IT artifacts include points, badges, status, reputation systems, and other features that facilitate verification of self-identity (e.g., Khansa et al. 2015). Among various IT artifacts, we focus on three types of mechanisms that support reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image specific to our research context of knowledge-sharing online communities. First, users whose questions have been answered by others may be more likely to answer others' questions in return. Second, users may care about the evaluation from their peers, through IT artifacts that facilitate user interactions, such as up-votes and acceptance of answers. Third, the community awards badges to users when they contribute, which improves users' selfimage and serves as a signaling mechanism.

Dynamics of Motivation and Contribution



Dynamics of Motivation and Contribution



Despite the growing literature on user motivations and motivating mechanisms, a majority of these studies build on an implicit static assumption. That is, the relationship between motivating mechanisms and user contributions does not change over time. This is a strong assumption, especially if we examine user contributions over a long time. It is because user motivations often evolve with their changing personal characteristics and their interactions with the community via the channel of various IT artifacts, leading to the fluctuation of contributions (Franzoni and Sauermann 2014).

The internalized extrinsic motivation and the facilitating IT artifacts may have different effects when user motivations are evolving. We expect reciprocity to enhance user motivation. But this effect may be less salient for highly motivated individuals because they contribute disproportionally more than they receive. For peer recognition, users may feel satisfied with their current good reputation and not contribute further. Indeed, research finds that users may decrease their contributions after reaching a certain incentive hierarchy (Goes et al. 2016). With large amount of badges, users may suffer from the {\textquotedbl}moral licensing{\textquotedbl} effect, where people may feel justified behaving non-prosocially when they have done something prosocial (Gneezy et al. 2012). Having contributed to the online community and been endorsed by badges, users may sit on their laurels and feel entitled not to contribute subsequently.

Modeling the dynamic process in a static way leads to problematic estimation and misleading implications. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework of dynamics that differs from the literature in two dimensions. First, we propose motivation state as a general construct to characterize the individual's propensity to contribute, and model it as a mediator between the motivating mechanisms and user contributions. Second, we relax the assumption that an individual's motivation state is fixed, and allow it to change over time. Our model also allows the impact of motivating mechanisms to be heterogeneous when users are in different motivation states. As such, we introduce a general model to explain the dynamics of user contributions.

Further, our approach has an evident empirical advantage. Prior studies use survey data to measure the psychological state of contributing (e.g., Ray et al. 2014). However, these constructs are hard to quantify with consensus. It is also costly to survey a large number of users over time to reveal the dynamics. Instead, we use observational data to infer motivation states and characterize individual dynamics. This approach enables community managers to estimate the dynamic motivation states of all users.

We make a distinction between the dynamics at the community level and at the individual user level. At the community level, the dynamics may come from membership turnover (Butler 2001). Recent studies find that more turnover may be better for the community at the knowledge-retention stage of the life cycle (Ransbotham and Kane 2011). However, it remains unclear how dynamics at the aggregated level may come from individual-level behaviors, and what mechanisms community designers can use to promote the desired outcome. To narrow this gap, we focus on the dynamics of user motivation and contribution at the individual level.

Model the Dynamics of User Contribution

One challenge of capturing individual-level dynamics is that the structure of such dynamics is usually unobservable. To capture this latent structure, the discrete state space model is a useful approach in the literature (e.g., Heckman 1981). For example, an individual's present decision depends on his past decision. In most of these models, the states are observable (e.g., brand switching of customers). Still, they tend to ignore other dynamics that could contribute to the change of states. In many other scenarios, however, we cannot observe the underlying states that drive the individual-level dynamics (e.g., motivation states in our research context). In this case, the hidden Markov model (HMM) can be useful.

An HMM is a stochastic process that consists of three elements: a finite set of hidden states, observed outcomes conditional on the hidden state, and the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another. It has wide applications in modeling stock market volatility (e.g., Ryden et al. 1998), business cycles (e.g., Hamilton 1989), customer relationship management (Netzer et al. 2008), and the mental states of patients in healthcare communities (Yan and Tan 2014). As far as we are aware, HMM has not yet been applied to modeling user contributions in online communities. Furthermore, we incorporate HMM into the public goods model (Benabou and Tirole 2006) to formalize the dynamic effect of motivating mechanisms. This structural modeling approach allows us to explicitly characterize the dynamics of user contributions at the individual level.

(2) From time t-1 to t, the user could switch to any state with certain probability, which is affected by the user's interaction with the community, such as how his contribution is evaluated by the peers. The community interactions are enabled by various IT artifacts that work through motivating mechanisms (e.g., reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image).

Research Context



Research Context



We study our research questions in an online community called StackExchange (stackexchange.com), which is a representative, large knowledge-sharing platform based on Wikipedia-style voluntary contributions. It started in 2008 with StackOverflow, a knowledge sharing website on programming. Now it has expanded to more than 100 subsites covering widespread technical (e.g., math, Tex) and nontechnical (e.g., cooking, bicycle) topics. On each subsite, users ask topic-related questions and provide answers. Users can also vote, comment, and revise other users' questions and answers as they do in Wikipedia, which allows the community to improve the content collectively.

Like many other online communities, StackExchange faces the challenge to maintain user participation. To cope with this, StackExchange employs various mechanisms to encourage user contribution and to sustain the high quality of questions and answers. For example, when a user receives 10 upvotes on one of his answers, he earns a {\textquotedbl}Nice Answer{\textquotedbl} badge. If the answer receives more than 40 up-votes and is accepted by the question poster, he is rewarded a {\textquotedbl}Guru{\textquotedbl} badge. Our sample includes 158 types of badges and they have been awarded for 414,761 times. A user can also earn reputation points, which are displayed together with the badges right below the user name on the profile page. These mechanisms serve as important channels for the users' identity verification.

These features help us understand user behaviors when knowledge collaboration is organized in such a voluntary community. First, it provides detailed data about user interactions. For example, we can observe when a user receives an up-vote on his answer, and whether his answer has been accepted. Such fine-grained user-level data help us identify the effect of different interactions on users' transition probabilities. Second, as many other online communities are using similar motivating mechanisms, our analysis could be generalized in a broader sense. For example, peer voting is used in crowdsourcing ideation initiatives (Huang et al. 2014), and the badge system is one important device in many online communities (Piskorski et al. 2010).

We employ SuperUser because of its data quality, as it is one of the largest subsites on StackExchange by the number of contributions. It employs various mechanisms to engage users, such as voting and badge systems. Hence, the site has rich information on user interactions that are appropriate to study our research questions.

Community and User Level Trends



We first demonstrate the general trends of the data in Figure 2. With the exception of the surge around the launch of the community, the numbers of new questions (graph a) and answers (graph b) are relatively stable over time. Similarly, the trends are stable for the numbers of badges and up-votes, as shown in graphs (d) and (e), respectively. Graph (c) plots the number of accepted answers each day. The stable trend suggests that question posters deem the quality of answers being consistent over time. We also plot in graph (f) the average up-votes per answer, which indicates the overall quality of the answers in the community. The trend is stable except for a decline at the initial stage. Overall, SuperUser is a relatively healthy community with steady contributions in our sample.

The contributions at the individual level, however, show a different pattern. Figure 3(a) presents the average number of answers contributed by each user over time. The contribution shows a declining trend. However, some users stay for a long time in the community. Figure 3(b) shows a histogram of contribution tenure, which is defined as the days between the first and last answers of each user. We can see significant heterogeneity in the time span during which users contribute. For those users contributing for a long time, understanding their behaviors and motivations can help develop sustainable online communities.

We further drill down to the individual level and plot the contributions of five representative users from our sample in Figure 4 (user IDs anonymized). Each row shows the answers of a user over the sample period. Each point represents the number of answers contributed by that user. A point is missing if the user does not contribute at a particular time. We observe that even relatively active users exhibit substantial fluctuation of contributions during their tenure. They actively contribute for some time periods, while idling for other periods. Our goal is to model the fluctuation of user contributions (dynamics), and study the influence of different motivating mechanisms that drive such dynamics of active (or lack of) contributions.

 abstract = {A number of experimental studies have documented that financial rewards discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or, rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general; a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop being donors if given 10Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women, but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications for research and public policy are discussed.},

@article{Ashraf.2014,
 abstract = {Organizations often use non-monetary awards to incentivize performance. Awards may affect behavior through several mechanisms: by conferring employer recognition, by enhancing social visibility, and by facilitating social comparison. In a nationwide health worker training program in Zambia, we design a field experiment to unbundle these mechanisms. We find that employer recognition and social visibility increase performance while social comparison reduces it, especially for low-ability trainees. These effects appear when treatments are announced and persist through training. The findings are consistent with a model of optimal expectations in which low-ability individuals exert low effort in order to avoid information about their relative ability.},

We illustrate our arguments by contrasting forms of organizing often considered novel, such as Linux, Wikipedia, and Oticon, against their traditional counterparts. We conclude that even when there may be little that existing theory cannot explain about individual elements in these new forms of organizing, opportunities for new theorizing lie in understanding the bundles of co-occurring elements that seem to underlie them and why the same bundles occur in widely disparate organizations.

@article{Abadie.2005,
 abstract = {The difference-in-differences (DID) estimator is one of the most popular tools for applied research in economics to evaluate the effects of public interventions and other treatments of interest on some relevant outcome variables. However, it is well known that the DID estimator is based on strong identifying assumptions. In particular, the conventional DID estimator requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if pre-treatment characteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable are unbalanced between the treated and the untreated. That would be the case, for example, if selection for treatment is influenced by individual-transitory shocks on past outcomes (Ashenfelter's dip). This article considers the case in which differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and controls. It is shown that, in such a case, a simple two-step strategy can be used to estimate the average effect of the treatment for the treated. In addition, the estimation framework proposed in this article allows the use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment varies with changes in observed characteristics.},

 abstract = {Population health interventions are essential to reduce health inequalities and tackle other public health priorities, but they are not always amenable to experimental manipulation. Natural experiment (NE) approaches are attracting growing interest as a way of providing evidence in such circumstances. One key challenge in evaluating NEs is selective exposure to the intervention. Studies should be based on a clear theoretical understanding of the processes that determine exposure. Even if the observed effects are large and rapidly follow implementation, confidence in attributing these effects to the intervention can be improved by carefully considering alternative explanations. Causal inference can be strengthened by including additional design features alongside the principal method of effect estimation. NE studies often rely on existing (including routinely collected) data. Investment in such data sources and the infrastructure for linking exposure and outcome data is essential if the potential for such studies to inform decision making is to be realized.},

It says that the characteristics of OCs that acquires collaboration is the fluidity, which generates a dynamic flow of resources in and out of the community including the passion, identity and social disembodiment of ideas. It states that the knowledge collaboration in OCs involves individual acts which include the offering, recombining, and integrating of knowledge to others. Moreover, knowledge collaboration is a critical element for the sustainability of OCs.},

 abstract = {Online communities foster unprecedented creativity, but at the same time they challenge the contemporary organisational boundary literature. They represent a new kind of nontraditional, nonhierarchical organisation where boundaries go beyond efficient (economic and legal) transaction logics to include boundary logics of identity, power and competence that need to be integratively managed. Moreover, these boundaries are not necessarily under the control of management, but rather are constantly negotiated between the platform providers, community members and content owners whose materials are used in collaborative production. In this paper, we explore the questions of how boundaries interact and how they can be managed integratively to render creative content production. Our empirical study involves an exploratory case research design of two established music remix sites: nin.com and ccMixter.org. We report on the community boundaries and their interdependencies, as well as on how the interdependencies are related to the goals and creative content production of online communities. The paper offers new insight into the role of integrative boundary management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

 abstract = {Recent ICT advances have allowed companies to interact with external stakeholders, especially users, in more efficient and effective ways, with the result that more and more companies are striving to take advantage of these new opportunities and harness their users' creative potential by integrating them into core business processes. Successful companies like Threadless or Dell - which were designed to allow user innovation and co-creation from the outset - have clearly demonstrated the potential value of such approaches. However, introducing user-centric value creation processes at established companies is a complex task, requiring major adaptations to traditional manufacturer-centered business models. At present, little is known about how such companies can successfully implement user-centric business models: this article explores (1) the success factors for attracting and engaging users in core business processes, and (2) effective strategies to overcome internal resistance at established companies wishing to introduce user-centric business models. We apply a multi-case comparison methodology between three well-known companies (LEGO, IBM and Coloplast) which have successfully integrated users into their core business processes, and find that implementing user-centric business models successfully requires a comprehensive approach encompassing an appropriate social software design, a transparent intellectual property policy, proper incentive systems, evolutional learning and nurturing as well as employee empowerment.

This study is the first to explicitly examine how user-innovators gather the information and assistance they need to develop their ideas and how they share and diffuse the resulting innovations. Specifically, this exploratory study analyzes the context within which individuals who belong to voluntary special-interest communities develop sports-related consumer product innovations. We find that these individuals often prototype novel sports-related products and that they receive assistance in developing their innovations from fellow community members. We find that innovation-related information and assistance, as well as the innovations themselves, are freely shared within these communities. The nature of these voluntary communities, and the {\textquotedbl}institutional{\textquotedbl} structure supporting innovation and free sharing of innovations is likely to be of interest to innovation researchers and managers both within and beyond this product arena.

@article{Goes.2016,
 abstract = {To motivate user contributions, user-generated content sites routinely deploy incentive hierarchies, where users achieve increasingly higher statuses in the community after achieving increasingly more difficult goals. Yet the existing empirical literature remains largely unclear whether such hierarchies are indeed effective in inducing user contributions. We gather data from a large online crowd-based knowledge exchange to answer this question, and draw on goal setting and status hierarchy theories to study users' contributions before and after they reach consecutive ranks on a vertical incentive hierarchy. We find evidence that even though these glory-based incentives may motivate users to contribute more before the goals are reached, user contribution levels drop significantly after that. The positive effect on user contribution appears only temporary. Moreover, such impacts are increasingly smaller for higher ranks. Our results highlight some unintended and heretofore undocumented effects of incentive hierarchies, and have important implications for business models that rely on user contributions, such as knowledge exchange and crowdsourcing, as well as the broader phenomenon of gamification in other contexts.

 abstract = {In internet culture, lurkers are a special group of website users who regularly login to online communities but seldom post. This study aims to provide an overall understanding of lurkers by explaining the definition of lurkers, discussing the reasons for lurking and providing suggestions on de-lurking. To understand the reason for lurking, this study first explains why people participate in online communities by building an integrated model of motivational factors of online behaviors. This model classifies motivational factors into four categories: the nature of the online community, individual characteristics, the degree of commitment and quality requirement. Based on this model, four types of lurking reasons are identified: environmental influence, personal preference, individual-group relationship and security consideration. Finally, several strategies for motivating participation in online communities are provided, including external stimuli, improved user-friendliness, encouragement of participation and guidance for newcomers.},

 abstract = {The 1926 observation by Lotka that the number of highly productive scientists was a relatively small fraction of all scientists has been extended to patented technology. Specifically, Lotka observed that for every 100 scientists who produce one paper there are approximately 10022, or 25, who produce two papers, 10032, or 11, who produce three, etc., with only one scientist in the set who will produce ten papers. An investigation of the number of patents per inventor was carried out for four companies, two American and two Japanese, in the area of semiconductors. For all four cases a Lotka-like distribution was found, with a relatively small number of highly productive inventors with their names on ten or more patents, and a large number of inventors with their names on only one, and a general factor of ten difference in productivity between the most- and the least-productive inventors.},
